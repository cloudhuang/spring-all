  <para>The Spring Data MongoDB project applies core Spring concepts to
    the development of solutions using the MongoDB document style data store. 
    We provide a "template" as a high-level abstraction for storing and querying
    documents. You will notice similarities to the JDBC support in the Spring
    Framework.
